want to classify the breathing rate 

the breathing rate is how many times your chest rises and falls over minute. 

count the number of times the acceleration graph crosses 0 then divide by 2
or could count the number of peaks

Display a number on the OLED which is how many breaths per minute 

need to work out how to read reading for 10 seconds - need to do a while loop with current time - start time and then loop while it is less than 10 seconds.
